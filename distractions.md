2021:
March 5: Untitled Fox Marvel film (Fox) (new)
Unscheduled: 
- Justice League, Part 2 - reportedly pushed back on schedule in favor of the Ben Affleck-directed The Batman solo film. We're keeping the date of June 14, 2019 off the schedule until official confirmation from Warner Bros. The Batman is taking that slot. 
By various reports, Warner Bros. is reportedly also developing a Man of Steel sequel, Gotham City Sirens film starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and directed by David Ayer, Deadshot and Nightwing solo films, a Suicide Squad sequel, a Batgirl film by Joss Whedon, and the delayed The Flash - last scheduled for March 16, 2018.
- Gambit (Fox): Delayed indefinitely due to script changes and departure of its second director. There are no recent reports suggesting the film is close to going into production.
- Fantastic Four 2 (Fox): While there hasn't been any official confirmation by Fox, this seems like a very unlikely bet with the future of the current incarnation of the franchise very much in doubt.
